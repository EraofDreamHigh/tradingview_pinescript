// The Moving Average Crossover trading strategy is possibly the most popular
// trading strategy in the world of trading. First of them were written in the
// middle of XX century, when commodities trading strategies became popular.
// This strategy is a good example of so-called traditional strategies. 
// Traditional strategies are always long or short. That means they are never 
// out of the market. The concept of having a strategy that is always long or 
// short may be scary, particularly in today’s market where you don’t know what 
// is going to happen as far as risk on any one market. But a lot of traders 
// believe that the concept is still valid, especially for those of traders who 
// do their own research or their own discretionary trading. 
// This version uses crossover of moving average and its exponential moving average.
